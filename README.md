## How does it look?

## How does it work?
RLRT will read the memory of a running Rocket League process and with the help of predefined memory offsets find what ranking you have at the moment. When any ranking has been updated, RLRT will notice this and keep track of the changes to a local database. RLRT supports viewing this data in a chart. This data can also be exported for further analasys.

## Is it safe to use?
The program will **only** read memory from the Rocket League process. This should be considered safe but we do not give any guarantee that it will not trigger any anti cheat systems or similar.
