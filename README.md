# Rocket League Ranking Tracker

## What is it?
Rocket League Ranking Tracker is a ranking tracker for Rocket League. What did you expect?

## How does it look?
TODO: Pics or it din't happen!

## How does it work?
RLRT will go into the memory of a running Rocket League process and with the help of predefined memory offsets find what ranking you have at the moment. This will then be saved so that you can export this data or view pretty charts.

## Does it exist any dangers?
The program will *only* read memory from the Rocket League process. This should be considered safe but we do not give any guaranty that it will not trigger any anti cheat systems or similar.
